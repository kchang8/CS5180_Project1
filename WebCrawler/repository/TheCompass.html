          <p>In order for Cal Poly Pomona to meet the high-tech needs of future generations of students, the university is going old-school.</p> 
          <p>Time-tested machines and tools such as backhoes, pneumatic drills and shovels will puncture concrete and asphalt and excavate soil so contractor crews can install a state-of-the art electrical distribution network that will provide reliability and a redundancy system to prevent outages. The campus electrical distribution system is reaching the end of its lifecycle.</p> 
          <p>To accomplish this unprecedented feat, the university launched the Electrical Infrastructure Upgrade (EIU) project in late June 2020 that will accommodate technological innovations of the coming decades. Facilities Planning and Management (FP&amp;M) is overseeing every aspect of the massive project, which ensures that the electrical needs of the university will be addressed for the next 60 years while also meeting current electrical code requirements.</p>
