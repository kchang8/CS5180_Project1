(you must be able to walk in on your own to receive care) and provides students with affordable, accessible and student-centered health care and wellness services so you can receive the care and assistance you may need. Services are available to all enrolled Cal Poly Pomona students, funded by a mandatory health fee that is included in tuition. Most services are covered by the health fee.</p> 
      <p>All Physicians are required to be Board Certified. In addition, the following positions are&nbsp;Certified and/or Licensed by the State of California:</p>

      <h2><span style="font-family: var(--secondary-font); font-size: 1em;">National College Health Assessment (2018)</span></h2> 
      <p class="x_MsoNormal">The ACHA- National College Health Assessment II (ACHA-NCHA II) is a national survey that is organized by the American College Health Association to collect data regarding students’ health behaviors, habits, and perceptions on the most prevalent health topics on college campuses. Every two years, Cal Poly Pomona administers the ACHA-NCHA II to a random sample of the Cal Poly Pomona student body. The results help to guide and inform programs and practice to support the health and well-being of the student body. Below is a link to the Executive Summary of the most recent survey, conducted during Winter Quarter 2018.</p> 
      <p class="x_MsoNormal"><a href="../docs/ncha-ii-2018-web.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ACHA-NCHA 2018 Executive Summary</a></p> 
      <h2>Mandatory Health Fee</h2> 
      <p>The Mandatory Student Health Fee provides students access and services to Student Health &amp; Wellness Services throughout the academic semester. Eligibility for services starts with the first day of the semester and lasts through the end of the break period immediately following that semester. In addition, fall semester eligibility begins with the first day of the break period preceding the start of the semester, provided the student is registered and fees have been paid. The health fee covers only those services provided on campus. Outside referrals are at the expense of each student. We do not accept any outside insurance so additional expenses must be paid at the time they are received.<br><br>If you are not enrolled during summer term, but intend to return in the fall (“Continuing Student Status”), you may use the health services on a fee-per-visit basis (roughly 1/3 of the established fee) for the first 3 visits. After that, you do not have to pay a visit charge.</p>
